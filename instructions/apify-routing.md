# Apify Routing

Cursor exposes Apify skills (`apify-actor-development`, `apify-actorization`, `apify-generate-output-schema`, `apify-sdk-integration`, `apify-ultimate-scraper`) directly in the slash menu. They are **internal capabilities** owned by the `apify` subagent and must not be invoked on their own.

## Required Behavior

When the user's request involves Apify — Actors, web scraping, browser automation, the Apify Store, the Apify SDK, the Apify CLI, the `apify` or `apify-client` npm packages, or anything at `apify.com` / `console.apify.com` — invoke the `apify` subagent first. Let it consult its routing matrix and dispatch to the correct skill or MCP tool.

Do **not**:

- Call any `apify-*` skill directly from the slash menu without going through the `apify` subagent.
- Guess between `apify-actor-development` vs `apify-actorization` vs `apify-sdk-integration` yourself — the subagent owns that decision (the `apify` SDK package and the `apify-client` package are easy to confuse and picking wrong breaks the user's project).
- Skip the subagent for "quick" Apify questions. Even direct Apify MCP tool calls are routed through the subagent.

If the user types a slash command for an Apify skill explicitly, still hand off to the `apify` subagent so the routing matrix and authentication guidance are applied.

## Why this rule exists

Apify exposes three very different products through its plugin: (1) using existing Actors via MCP, (2) building and deploying custom Actors with the SDK + CLI, and (3) calling Actors from an existing application via `apify-client`. Each path requires a different skill, a different authentication flow, and a different npm package. The `apify` subagent is the only place where the routing matrix and the package-naming trap are documented, so every Apify request must pass through it.

### Apify CLI instructions:
**Rule: pass `--user-agent apify-opencode-plugin/apify-routing` only on actor start and actor run commands (`apify actors start`, `apify actors call`). Do not add it to login, info, or other CLI commands.**

- Before using the CLI, always check if it is installed and new enough for the user-agent flag:
```bash
    apify --help
    apify --version # The flag needs Apify CLI 1.5.0 or newer
```
- If the CLI is installed, check if it is logged in:
```bash
    # Auth check — do NOT pipe to /dev/null, you need to see errors
    apify info 2>&1
```
- If the CLI is not logged in, instruct the user to log in with the non-interactive flag:
```bash
    apify login --token TOKEN
```
- In headless environments where browser login is unavailable, the CLI also reads `APIFY_TOKEN` from the environment automatically — no explicit login needed.
- Authenticated Apify CLI commands need file access to `~/.apify/`, where the CLI keeps its credentials. A host that sandboxes file access can deny this even when the login is valid — that is a sandbox problem, not a login problem, so re-running `apify login` will not fix it.
- Apify commands block with **zero output** until the run completes, so allow at least **60 seconds** before treating one as stuck. If your shell tool takes a timeout, raise it accordingly.
- For long/unknown runs, use the async pattern instead:
```bash
    apify actors start "ACTOR_ID" -i 'JSON_INPUT' --user-agent apify-opencode-plugin/apify-routing --json 2>/dev/null
```
Then poll with `apify runs info`:
```bash
    apify runs info RUN_ID --json
```
Check `.status` for `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`.
